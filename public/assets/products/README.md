# Placeholder Assets

This directory contains placeholder images for the Chat Bot Sidekick project.

## Book Images

The following book cover images are needed:

- fellowship.jpg (The Fellowship of the Ring)
- two-towers.jpg (The Two Towers)  
- return-king.jpg (The Return of the King)
- hunger-games.jpg (The Hunger Games)
- catching-fire.jpg (Catching Fire)
- mockingjay.jpg (Mockingjay)
- placeholder.jpg (Default fallback image)

These can be replaced with actual book cover images or generated placeholder images.

## Recommended Dimensions

- Book covers: 300x400px (3:4 aspect ratio)
- Format: JPG or PNG
- File size: Keep under 100KB for optimal loading

## Adding Images

To add actual book cover images:

1. Place image files in this directory
2. Ensure filenames match those referenced in the products.json data
3. Optimize images for web (compress if needed)

For now, the application will show a gray placeholder with "No Image" text when images are not found.
